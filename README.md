# CC1 - Tea Cozy Project
 
In this project challenge, I created a fictional tea shop website with some of the assets provided by 
CodeCademy.

I made some changes to the original design so as to make the site more modern and more beautiful.

That's the first version of the site and it is not responsive, once the challenge didn't request. However,
I expect to make the v2 as soon as possiblie with this feature.
